IP-infosystem
Version 1.0

This is a small project to create a program that shows you information about IP-Addresses
It uses ipapi.co and ipify.org for the information and tkinter for the graphical interface

Known bugs:
- old label text does not vanish when doing repeated searches, only under the new text.

The base code and inspiration for this project comes from
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-location-information-of-ip-address-using-python/
